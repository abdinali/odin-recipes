				<h2 class="subheading">Instructions</h2>
				<ol>
					<li>
						Preheat the oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C). Wrap outside of a lightly
						greased (with cooking spray) 9-inch springform pan with a double layer of
						heavy-duty aluminum foil.
					</li>
					<li>
						Stir together cookies, melted butter, and granulated sugar in a bowl. Press
						onto bottom and 1-inch up sides of prepared pan.
					</li>
					<li>
						Bake in the preheated oven until crust is set, 7 to 8 minutes. Transfer to a
						wire rack; cool completely, 30 minutes.
					</li>
					<li>Preheat the oven again to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C).</li>
					<li>
						Process chopped strawberries in a food processor until completely smooth,
						about 1 minute, stopping to scrape down sides as needed. Set strawberry
						puree aside.
					</li>
					<li>
						Beat cream cheese with a stand mixer fitted with a paddle attachment on
						medium speed until creamy, 2 to 3 minutes. Gradually add sugar and flour,
						beating until smooth, about 1 minute. Add whole eggs, 1 at a time, beating
						on low speed just until blended after each addition (do not overbeat). Add
						egg yolks, 1 at a time, beating until just blended after each addition.
					</li>
					<li>
						Beat in reserved strawberry puree, vanilla, lemon zest, and lemon juice on
						low speed just until combined. Gently stir in food coloring gel until
						desired shade is reached.
					</li>
					<li>
						Pour batter into the prepared pan (pan will be full). Place cheesecake in a
						large roasting pan. Place roasting pan with cheesecake in preheated oven and
						pour very hot water into roasting pan half-way up sides of cheesecake.
					</li>
					<li>
						Bake in the preheated oven until center is almost set but still wobbly, 1
						hour and 10 minutes to 1 hour and 20 minutes. Turn oven off, and let
						cheesecake stand in oven, with door closed, 15 minutes.
					</li>
					<li>
						Remove cheesecake from oven, and gently run a knife around outer edge of
						cheesecake to loosen from sides of pan. (Do not remove sides of pan.) Cool
						completely in pan on a wire rack, about 2 hours. Cover with aluminum foil;
						chill 8 to 24 hours.
					</li>
					<li>
						Prepare Chocolate Ganache Topping: Bring cream to a light simmer in a small
						saucepan over medium. Place chopped chocolate in a small heatproof bowl.
						Pour hot cream over chocolate in bowl and let stand 1 minute. Whisk
						chocolate mixture until completely smooth. Let mixture cool until very
						slightly warm, whisking occasionally, about 20 minutes.
					</li>
					<li>
						Assemble Cheesecake: Dip a few whole strawberries in ganache and chill until
						ready to top cheesecake. Remove sides of pan from cheesecake and place on a
						serving platter. Slowly pour ganache over top of cheesecake, spreading to
						edges with a small offset spatula. Chill for 1 hour.
					</li>
					<li>
						Top cheesecake with whole and halved strawberries and chocolate-dipped
						strawberries.
